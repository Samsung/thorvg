- Here is a overall commit message what we expect to review:
  
  - common composite: newly added path clipping feature

    We introduced new method Paint::composite() to support composite behaviors. </br>
    This allows paints to composite with other paints instances. </br>
    Composite behaviors depends on its compoite method type. </br>
    Here we firstly introduced "ClipPath" method to support clipping by path unit of paint.</br>    
    
    tagetPaint->composite(srcPaint, CompositeMethod::ClipPath);</br>
    
    Beaware if the source paint doesn't contain any path info, clipping won't be applied as you expected.
    
    @API Additions:</br>
    enum CompositeMethod {None = 0, ClipPath}; </br>
    Result Paint::composite(std::unique_ptr<Paint> target, CompositeMethod method) const noexcept;</br>

    @Examples: added ClipPath</br>

    @Issues: 49
